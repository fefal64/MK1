# Sir Ababol 2 Demo 2

Sir Ababol 2 started as a 48K MTE MK1 v4 game but it soon evolved to a standalone 128K game, as the engine didn't support 128K at the time, so parts were extracted from MK1 and a proprietary engine was built. This engine evolved several times and ended being a mixture of custom stuff and MK2.

This is a backport of one of the stages of the game as it was originally conceived.
